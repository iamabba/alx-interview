The Prime Game is a simple mathematical game where two players take turns selecting a positive integer. The goal is to be the player who selects the prime number. Here are the basic rules:

Two players take turns.
Players start with a given starting number, typically 1 or any positive integer.
On each turn, a player can choose to increment the current number by 1.
The first player to reach a prime number wins the game.
For example, if the starting number is 1, the game might progress like this:

Player 1 chooses 1 (1 is not prime).
Player 2 chooses 2 (2 is prime).
In this scenario, Player 2 wins because they selected the prime number 2.

The Prime Game is a fun way to practice recognizing prime numbers and can be played with various rule variations, such as changing the starting number or allowing players to choose any positive integer on their turn.
